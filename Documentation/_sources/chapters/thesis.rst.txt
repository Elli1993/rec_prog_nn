Abstract
===========

Recognizing emotions is a vital part of human communication, whereas children
suffering from Autistic Spectrum Condition (ASC) show severe problems in that
regard. Thus, recent research aims at supporting ASC children in their psychological
development by giving them intelligent toys at hand to playfully learn and reflect on
the emotions they express and recognize. This thesis contributes to this research by
automatically recognizing emotions in acoustic speech signals from ASC children. Since
according data tends to be available in small amounts due to reduced communication
abilities among ASC affected personalities, inferring knowledge from related tasks to
emotion recognition on ASC children is of crucial importance to the problem. To that
end, this paper evaluates a novel and promising transfer learning technique called
Progressive Neural Networks on two ASC children data sets: ASC-Inclusion and DEENIGMA.
This was done for paralinguistic cross–task learning using ASC-Inclusion
data. There they proved as a promising alternative to the traditional pre–training/fine–
tuning approach. Secondly, Recurrent Progressive Neural Networks are introduced as
an recurrent extension of Progressive Neural Networks to be used for time continuous
prediction. Those were tested for cross–task learning on valence and arousal on
the DE-ENIGMA data set and for cross-corpus learning with both data sets. They
slightly improve the results achieved and thus are regarded as promising alternative to
multi–task learning.

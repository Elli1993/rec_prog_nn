Welcome to P-RNNs for Emotion Recognition's documentation!
==========================================================

Here you can find a full documentation of the Code used in the Master Thesis *Transfer Learning for 
Emotion Recognition on Multimodal Data from Children with Autistic Spectrum Condition (ASC)*. 
First the complete Master Thesis is attached to provide theoretical insights and results on the two 
data sets ASC-Inclusion and DE-ENGIMA. Afterwards a Quick Start Chapter gives some insight on how to use 
the provided Code either with the data provided by University of Augsburg or with a simple toy data 
example. Finally a full documentation of the Code is provided.
